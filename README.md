A collection of useful stuff I have figured out over the years.

I licensed it by GPL3.0 in the hopes that if you find it useful, make improvements, and share your improvements back either as a PR, bug report or forking into your own.

But if GPL3.0 doesn't suit you for whatever reason, use any FSF approved license that you like.

I suggest keeping a note/credit back to https://github.com/29039/29039s-useful-stuff/ so you know where you got it from, especially if you are redistributing to somewhere else.
